# Nothing Calculator

As the name suggests, this is a calculator intended to calculate, well, nothing particularly useful.

It's just a silly project I've decided to make in Godot while playing [Nothing Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2788630/Nothing_Together/), a game about doing absolutely nothing.
All that this calculator is meant to do is calculate the time that it would take to unlock all multiplayer achievements.
